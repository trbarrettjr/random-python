# random-python

Random Python Applications that I have done.

## enc.py

This is a simple xor script.  I was testing it for something, but decided not going to work with it.
**This is not secure for encryption!  DO NOT USE!!!**

### text.text
Orignal text file that was used to XOR

### text.enc
Encoded file from the text file after being XOR'd (if that is a word!)

## onetimepad

Reading from Bruce Schnier's book and was talking about one time pads.  I tryed my hand at making a one-time pad via python.  Meh...
